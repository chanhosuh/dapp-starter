# dapp-starter

Basic starter-kit for creating a DApp.  Uses Truffle to compile, migrate, and test.  Frontend is React.

What's included:
- some boilerplate for testing locally with `ganache-cli` and deploying with Infura
- utility javascript functions to instantiate web3 and contracts
- the minimal dependencies to get started with truffle, web3, and solidity, including oft-overlooked things like linters, testing tools, etc.
